# Send the operator a file on Telegram

Specs and plans to approve go as HTML (Markdown is hard to read on a phone); any other
file (report, log, PDF, image) up to 50 MB goes as it is.

Read on demand from `chief-template.md` step 11 (Telegram inbox). Run from the repo root:

```
bun scripts/telegram/chief-route.ts send-file <chat_id> <path> ["<caption>"]
```

- A `.md` or `.markdown` path is rendered to a standalone HTML page first (raw HTML in the
  source is shown as text; the page blocks scripts).
- The file is COPIED into `<bridge root>/outgoing/<id>/` and one `document_path` line is
  queued in the chat's outbox; the poller uploads it with `sendDocument`. The poller ships
  only a regular, non-symlink file whose real path is inside `outgoing/`, so a path elsewhere
  is refused and the chat is told. A group session's outbox never sends a file.
- A missing path, a directory or a file over 50 MB is refused with a clear error and a
  non-zero exit; nothing is queued.
- **A spec or plan page is checked before it queues**. A file under
  `specs/{design,designs,spec,plan,plans}/` or `specs/HIMMEL-<n>/`, or one a critic file names, is a
  signature page. It is refused, naming the verdict file and queueing nothing, unless its highest-round
  `<spec>.critic-spec-r<n>.md` AND `<spec>.critic-plan-r<n>.md` each end in `SPEC CLEAN` / `PLAN CLEAN`
  and carry a `CONTENT-SHA256 <sha> <relative path>` line whose file still hashes to that sha (a spec or
  plan edited after the critic read it fails). A `<stem>.html` sign page beside a `<stem>.md` goes only
  when the latest spec critic also sealed that `.html`. The Telegram caption opens with the verdict lines
  read from those files (your own caption follows), and a rendered page opens with them too. A critic
  return is sealed, once per file the critic read, with
  `bash scripts/handover/chief-kit/critic-seal.sh <verdict file> <file it read> <sha the critic quoted>`
  (the return itself must quote that sha); a verdict with no such line is refused until it is. Reports, logs and audits under no such path send
  as before. There is no read-only form: a signature-class file goes through the check or does not send.
- The check covers `send-file` only. A file the bridge chat copies into `outgoing/` and queues itself is
  not checked (ponytail: a hand-built `.html` there carries no link to its spec; upgrade path:
  a follow-up that starts with a ruling on how to tell a report from a spec page; the PR names its ticket).
- A queued line that carries both `text` and `document_path` sends the text, then the file.
- The bridge never receives your path on its own: you run `send-file`; the operator's receipt
  is the proof (quote it in the ticket).
